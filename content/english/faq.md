## A Briefing

Here you will find simple answers to some frequently asked questions. We hope this will serve as a quick guide to participating with ECEA in whatever form you are able. If this is your first time here, I encourage you navigate to the ['Join ECEA' page](/get-started) and read the welcome book. Some of the information here is greatly expanded upon in that document. If you are looking for answers regarding rules, I suggest you refer to our [rule book here](/documents/ecea-rulebook-current.pdf)

#### 1. Who are the ECEA?

The ECEA is the most diverse off road association around with something for the family, youth rider, racer or enthusiast. We are a club-based, volunteer organization. What we do is not possible without our clubs, their members, and people like you who are passionate about riding. [Please navigate the to 'Join Us' page and read the welcome book!](/get-started)

#### 2. Should I join a club?

Yes! The foundation of ECEA is built on clubs. Every event on the schedule is hosted by a club on property they either own, lease, or otherwise have permission to use. Without dedicated club members who help maintain and mark trail, among many other things, these events would not be possible and there would be no ECEA. Please refer to the [clubs page](/clubs) and find out if there is a club near you.  

It is important to note that you do not need to be a member of a club to ride ECEA events, however you MUST be a member of a club to be eligible for Enduro Championship awards. See the [rule book here](/documents/ecea-rulebook-current.pdf) for more information or continue to the [enduro section of this FAQ.](/faq/enduro)

#### 3. How do I join a club?

Simply navigate to the [clubs page](/clubs), look for a club near you, and reach out to the listed contact for that club either by phone, text, or email. They will be happy to hear from you!

#### 4. Can I ride?

If you have an offroad motorcycle, there is surely something for you here. Whether young or old, whether you want to race or just ride for fun, you will find opportunity with us.

## Enduro  
#### 1. What is an Enduro?

An enduro is a race against a clock testing the riderâ€™s ability to negotiate technical terrain and maintain apredetermined time schedule. If you have ever seen an off-road car rally, the format is very similar. For a more detailed explaination, please take a peek at our [welcome book here](/documents/ecea-welcome-book.pdf)

You do NOT need to be a member of a club to ride an enduro but you MUST be a member of a club if you want to be eligible for championship awards for the season.

#### 2. How do I sign up for an enduro?

To sign up for an ECEA Enduro, you need an AMA Number and you will need to register yourself for the ECEA Enduro Series. It goes without saying that you need an offroad motorcycle, but make sure before you sign up for the event that you will pass the hosting club's inspection! Some events will require a license plate, headlight, and tail light be fixed to your bike because they use public roads to transfer you from trail to trail. However, some events are closed-course and do not require a license plate or lights on your machine. Pay attention to the event details posted on the schedule and carefully read the event flyer which will be made available a few weeks before the event.

At the time of writing (Jan 2023), most Enduro's are pre-entry only. Meaning that you MUST sign up online before the day of the event. However, this is not always the case so be sure to read the event details on the [event schedule](/events). I suggest you pre-register because the entry fee is always at least a few dollars less than what it is the day of the event. 

#### 3. What should I expect when I arrive at the enduro event?

Typically parking is in a field so maybe leave the lamborghini at home. After you park, head over to the sign-up tent with your helmet. Hopefully you will have pre-registered! The enduro scoring team will scan your moto-tally transponder which is just a sticker placed on your helmet. If you do not have a sticker, one will be provided to you at the sign-up tent. A number will be given to you which is to be placed on the front number plate or headlight of your bike. This is so the workers at checkpoints can write your number down in their backup score sheets.

After you've signed in, get ready to go! Get geared and warm up your bike. Remember that your start time is equal to the start time of the event plus your row number. For example, if the event starts at 9AM and you are on row 14, you start at 9:14AM. If your number is 36, you start at 9:36AM. Double check the start time of the event when you sign up - most are at 9AM, but occasionally an event start time will be 8AM! I suggest you arrive to the start area at least 10 minutes before your start time. Take a breather. Relax. Calm those nerves.

The workers at the start line will flag you when to start. And if you have any questions, chat with the other riders on your row! You'll be with them all day and I've made a great deal of friends by sparking conversation throughout the day. 

#### 4. Does my bike need to be road legal?

It depends on the event. As of the time of writing (Jan 2023), all enduro's hosted in New Jersey require a license plate be fixed to your bike. This is because the club's have permission to use public roads to transfer the riders from trail to trail where needed. Other enduro events may or may not require a plate so please read the event flyer when it is released!

#### 5. What is a closed course?

A closed course event is an event where the bikes do not need to be road legal.

## Hare Scramble
#### 1. What is a Hare Scramble?

A Hare Scrambles is a mass start event where riders complete as many laps as they can over the duration of the event. The courses are generally natural terrain and lesstechnical, more open, and faster than an enduro. The competitor completing the most laps with the lowest elapsed time is the winner. You do not need to be a member of a club to ride these events, but when you register for the hare scramble series you must sign up as an 'associate member' to be eligible for championship awards.

For a more detailed explaination, please take a peek at our [welcome book here](/documents/ecea-welcome-book.pdf)

#### 2. How to sign up for a Hare Scramble?

To sign up for an ECEA Hare Scramble, you need an AMA Number and you will need to register yourself for the Hare Scramble Series. It goes without saying that you need an offroad motorcycle, but make sure before you sign up for the event that you will pass the hosting club's inspection! All hare scrambles are close-course, meaning that you do not need a lisence plate or anything to participate. You will see a lot of motocross bikes here! However you do need to wear an appropriate motorcycle helmet and motocross boots. Timberlands will not do and you will not pass inspection. Your motorcycle will be sound tested to stay under 96dB - but most factory bikes will pass this test so you shouldn't worry. Just don't roll in with open headers. Pay attention to the event details posted on the schedule and carefully read the event flyer which will be made available a few weeks before the event.

Be sure to read the event details on the [event schedule](/events). I suggest you pre-register because the entry fee is always at least a few dollars less than what it is the day of the event. 

#### 3. What should I expect when I arrive at the Hare Scramble?

There is typically a 'gate fee' to enter the property. This is separate from your race entry. Cost is typically $5-10 per person but consult the flyer for the event for exact details.  

After you park, you need to ask yourself a few things:  
\- Have you pre entered?  
\- Is your number on your helmet? On your bike?  
\- Do I have my transponder on my helmet?  

At the sign-up tent/trailer, you will be able to sign up (obviously) and you will be provided a transponder sticker for your helmet. You will also be provided stickers to be placed on the left side of your helmet and on the front number plate of your bike. If you have already registered (pre-entered) and have these things, you do not need to go to the sign-up trailer.

Next, grab your helmet and put on your MX boots. It's time to go to inspection. It's a good idea to warm your bike up a bit before you go there for the sound test. You do NOT need to be fully geared to pass inspection but you MUST have your helmet and boots.

## FastKIDZ
#### 1. What is FastKIDZ?

FastKIDZ are Hare Scrambles for kids! Riders start at 4 years old and go all the way up to 17 years old. These are held the day before the adult hare scrambles. In other words, kids always race on a Saturday and adults race on Sunday. Kids age 16 and up riding 125cc bikes or larger are eligible to race on Sunday in the adult race. If you don't know what I'm talking about, please take a peek at our [welcome book here](/documents/ecea-welcome-book.pdf) and then refer to the 'HARESCRAMBLE CLASSES' section of the [rule book](/documents/ecea-rulebook-current.pdf)

#### 2. How do I sign my kid up to ride?

To sign up for an ECEA Hare Scramble, your kid will need an AMA Number and you will need to register them for the fastKIDZ series. All riders MUST wear an appropriate motorcycle helmet and motocross boots. Timberland boots will not do and you will not pass inspection. Pay attention to the event details posted on the schedule and carefully read the event flyer which will be made available a few weeks before the event.

Be sure to read the event details on the [event schedule](/events). I suggest you pre-register because the entry fee is always at least a few dollars less than what it is the day of the event. 

#### 3. What should my family expect when we arrive at the event?

There is typically a 'gate fee' to enter the property. This is separate from your race entry. Cost is typically $5-10 per person but consult the flyer for the event for exact details.  

After you park, you need to ask yourself a few things:  
\- Have you pre entered?  
\- Is your number on your helmet? On your bike?  
\- Do I have my transponder on my helmet?  

At the sign-up tent/trailer, you will be able to sign your kid(s) up (obviously) and you will be provided a transponder sticker for their helmet. You will also be provided stickers to be placed on the left side of your child's helmet and on the front number plate of their bike. If you have already registered (pre-entered) and have these things, you do not need to go to the sign-up trailer.

Next, gear them up! It's time to go to inspection. The club just wants to make sure your kid is safe and has the appropriate gear and you're not sending them into the trail on a razer scooter. Have fun!

#### 4. Youth Scholarships

The East Coast Enduro Association (ECEA) has two scholarship programs in place:

\- The â€˜ECEA -Mike Little- Scholarshipâ€™ set up to recognize riders academically and their commitment to the amateur sport of off-road riding within the ECEA. Mike Little was a MCI members and acted as ECEA Treasurer for years.  

\- The â€˜Skip Stoner Memorial Scholarshipâ€™ set up to recognize achievement by a member in the memory of long-time devoted ECEA member, Skip Stoner. Skip was a mentor to many kids over the years. He and his family would open their shop, home, and hearts to help others.  

Applicants for the scholarships are selected on their scholastic accomplishments, course of study, and their demonstrated involvement in the ECEA.

The ECEA awards up to four scholarships in the amount of $500 each year and have different eligibility criteria. Applications must be received by August 31. Notifications to awardees will be made in December and acknowledged at our banquet. Be sure to pay attention to forthcoming information on the [fastKIDZ series page!](/series/fastkidz)

## Dual Sport
#### 1. What is a Dual Sport?

Dual Sports are NOT races. They are fun rides which tend to have a mixture of gravel roads and various trails. No Dual Sport event is the same so you might want to connect with some other riders to find out whether the conditions at an event are what you're looking for. Personally, I think every one is an absolute blast. Some events require the bikes to be road registered and some events do not, so be sure to read the event flyer!

#### 2. How to sign up for a Dual Sport?

You will need an AMA Number. Otherwise, refer to the [event page](/events) and the event flyer for details.

#### 3. What should I expect when I arrive at the Dual Sport?

Park then go to the sign up area for further details. Some clubs have documents for you to sign or a bike inspection to go through. Other clubs might not. So the best thing to do is read the flyer and if you still have questions then just ask.
