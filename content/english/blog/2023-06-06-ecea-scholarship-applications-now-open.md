## Press Release

Application Period Opens for East Coast Enduro Association Scholarships

Hainesport, NJ, June 4, 2023: The East Coast Enduro Association (ECEA) invites applications for its annual scholarships – the Mike Little Memorial and the Skip Stoner Memorial each worth $500. The East Coast Enduro Association (ECEA) has two scholarship programs in place – the ‘Mike Little Memorial Scholarship’ and the ‘Skip Stoner Memorial Scholarship’. Each have been set up to recognize ECEA riders both academically and technically with their commitment to the ECEA’s amateur sport of off- road riding in the memories of long-time devoted ECEA members, Mike Little and Skip Stoner. Skip was a mentor to many kids over the years. He and his family would open their shop, home, and hearts to help others. Mike Little, a past officer of the ECEA, always felt deeply about the youth in the ECEA series. Applicants for the scholarships are selected on their scholastic accomplishments, course of study, trade/technical certifications, and their demonstrated involvement in the ECEA. 

The ECEA awards up to four scholarships in the amount of $500 each year and have different eligibility criteria. Applications must be received by September 30, 2023. Notifications to awardees will be made in December 2023. To learn more about the ECEA Scholarships, visit www.ecea.org
