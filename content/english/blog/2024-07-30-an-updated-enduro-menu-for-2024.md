Bad news first...

The Stumpjumper Enduro hosted by MCI has been cancelled this year. If I recall correctly, the last time MCI ran the event was 2018 and it was a blast. We miss your enduro! Best of luck next year.

Ridge Riders Motorcycle Club's ambitious plans to have TWO enduro's this year have unfortunately gone over the bars and into the mud. Their plan was to host a traditional timekeeping event out of their former starting area and, rumor has it, host a 100 mile event! How I was so looking forward to that. Alas, RRMC will have to try again next year.

Before the good news, if you are not in a club or you have friends not in a club, please consider joining and encouraging them to join. Firstly, to be eligible for an enduro championship you must be in a club and volunteer for at least one event. But more importantly, ECEA is volunteer driven. We are all volunteers and without people with passion for the sport, it would be long gone by now. You don't need to dedicate your life to it, just a little bit of time here and there and it will go a long way. I've met many friends this way, some of them I consider quite close and you'd be doing your part to help keep ECEA and Enduro alive. If you are interested, check out the
