# The ECEA 2026 schedule is here!

The official ECEA schedule is finalized. Don't forget to get your harescramble number for the year. If you are an enduro racer, details on registration for the 2026 year are pending - usually coming out toward the end of January.

If you are an enduro racer and plan to race for a class championship, don't forget to join a club before February to guarantee all of your races count. Remember, enduros do have a volunteer requirement for anyone racing for championship points. ECEA is a volunteer organization with events run by clubs and their members. Head over to the Clubs page to see where you might fit and help keep the sport healthy and riding opportunities open.

Complete details for each event will be posted on the Events page as they are available.
