The Second weekend of July 2024. Rural New York State on a Hot Sunday morning. Sunshine, bright green rolling hills, farms, ponds and streams. Drive into the parking area where you see 200 of your friends scattered across the field. Bikes firing up, laughter, cursing, friendly banter, dogs and kids running around. The smell of two stroke oil and breakfast sandwiches floats on the wave of BS stories of past races coming from the different groups gathered under E-Z ups and club flags.

Getting ready to go, new and old friends coming by wishing you good luck. Nervous excitement all around. “Hey Pig Pen, did you check your seat bolt this morning”. I love these people. 

Charlie Stapleford, now well into his 80’s pulls up in his van, smiling from ear to ear “You ready, this is going to be a good one”. Somewhere behind me a man says to his friend “That’s Charlie, he is a legend”. Anxious energy as riders from the early rows begin to mount up and ride to the starting line. A club member steps forward with a microphone, we stop talking and face the flag. This man sings The Star-Spangled Banner. It’s a moving experience. Fireworks go off as he sings. Engines fire back up…..and the Adrenaline kicks in,

“One Minute”. “Let’s Go!”  

“30 seconds. “Let’s get it!”  

“10 seconds…….9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1” 

BRRRRAAAAAPPPPPPPP!

There are many reasons people love this race. The single track is awesome. The location is beautiful. The people are amazing and friendly. But there is something else. There is something about this race and this area of the country that is hard to put into words. There is something about “The Barbed Wire Experience”.


Is it the singing of the Star Spangled Banner and fireworks to start the race ?  
Is it the crowd that comes out the watch us try and make it up “The Slide” in the middle of the Enduro?  
Is it the tradition where the attractive women slap you on the ass when you arrive at the check?  
Is it the Beer truck at the finish line?  

There is something about this Event, this area of our country, and this group of people that reminds us of all that is good about our sport. Everyone who owns and rides dirt bikes should experience Barbed Wire Enduro at least once.
