Thank you for your interest in this yearâ€™s Scrub Pine 100. As the title suggests, OCCR is planning on an old school 100 ground mile enduro. There are two points of [](<>)clarification we would like to share before we go into details; It will NOT be 100 miles of whoops, and the third loop will be optional for C riders and select classes.

Loop 1 will be a fun dual sport ride with some checks along the way to keep everyone on schedule. Newer enduro enthusiasts and riders of a certain age will enjoy loop 1. 28 ground miles before returning to the campground for gas.

Loop 2 will become a bit more challenging as we begin to get into more technical sections and raise the speed averages. 36 ground miles before returning to the campground for gas.

At the end of Loop 2, All C classes, A55/B55, Masters, Golden Masters, Legends, Women, Dual Sport Vintage and Sportsman classes are concluded with official scoring. Loop 3 for these classes will be optional.

Loop 3 will be the most challenging of the day as the sections are longer and the resets shorter. 38 ground miles (or less) to the end.

Every entry must have a working headlight and an original license plate. Leave the license plate on as the DEP will be checking license plates throughout the day.

Chef Frank will again be serving the best meals and we will have shirts available at sign up. Pre entry opens on October 13th and we will accept cash entries on site until Keytime. If you are on the list that was denied entry at the start last year, please contact Donovan at DonovanMarvin@gmail.com to sign up. DO NOT sign up through [Moto-tally.com](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FMoto-tally.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExR3ZXaUtraXhKSEhKSGZIRAEefOt_FhsCCZNHe2sFtep5878jow-eU8u4KcewEEXOSRU9CDOCNRcAntcTu5o_aem_WQUkYyW4xQqq-RyY7kmUew&h=AT2q90XK6-Izq4kKiyh1fAwjok7wOqVePUEzmM7SLKotYBBdxOAPJY5Vxq4GiUtByUMJ31kz7dp15BK_8E4TYtIpH_e9WpMN-EY51-cgDVeyExcbqTzDd4YjIo823sGF4AbBJ7f7w-l2tLLmwfVpKw&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT00EK85MRcTNWsnPoOVhrIWkC64J2Pwlvuyj1vmCW1r-rm7eWGQHD4twGiOPe2PlMM7yMnCpnmjGXjzvfuxAnjYW6Jgu1QtAurvGlvWHJVjFTzAqs5bDCF3CdWLEdyNjQafjuzeWqVAGHMwxdYP_qyyMgDxLQDyvUGTrW9MjqnY6-rQJTqFJzKv_AfH65lTyqHfMX0yqCvh4qWHvMQ8ci3Wb2pfCvcjQOY6-sNm)
