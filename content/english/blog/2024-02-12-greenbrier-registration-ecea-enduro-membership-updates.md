The 2024 Enduro Season starter is fast approaching. There are a few things you need to know, especially if you intend on riding Greenbrier Enduro.

All racers MUST register for the season on moto-tally, even if you only race one enduro this year. You can find the registration link in the navigation bar on the top of this page at Enduro -> Enduro Series Registration, or you can [click here to register.](https://www.moto-tally.com/ECEA/Enduro/SeriesRegistration.aspx) The cost is $20.

All information regarding Greenbrier Enduro can be found [on the event page](https://ecea.org/events/enduro/24-en-tcsmc/). Most importantly, registration opens on February 17th at 8pm EST! Greenbrier Enduro sells out completely every year. If I remember correctly, it sold out in less than 20 minutes last year so you be at your computer ready to register with your AMA number ready to go, or risk missing out. You can find the registration link on the event page. Last important point - if you intend on registering for Greenbrier Enduro and you have not yet registered for the ECEA series via moto-tally (as mentioned above), DO IT NOW! Registrations take a day to process and if you wait until Saturday, you will miss out on Greenbrier! DO IT NOW!

Good luck to all this year, see you out there.
