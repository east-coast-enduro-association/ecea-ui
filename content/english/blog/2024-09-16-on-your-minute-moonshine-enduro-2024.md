We like to use the phrase “Not Supposed to” often in our speech. In general, this short phrase is all about expectations. Things we expect not to happen under normal circumstances. In the world of ECEA Enduros there are things that are not supposed to happen. 

In this day and age, a club is not supposed to lose access to land where they had an awesome race for years and then come back two years later with an even better track of land and an even better race course. But on Sunday it happened. In 2024 racers win MX and SX races on Honda 4 strokes, they are not supposed to win gnarly North East Enduros. But on Sunday someone did. A 16-year-old kid from down the road is not supposed to enter an Enduro and beat a group of world class riders but on Sunday Tyler Dibartolo did just that on his Honda 250rx.

This Sunday RORR and VRTF joined forces to put on the 50 th annual Moonshine Enduro on a new property just outside Fern Glen PA. Putting the race course aside, this property is one of the most gorgeous pieces of land we have raced on this year. The course flowed through beautiful forests with brown dirt and massive rock formations. I have no idea how the RORR/VRTF crew got access to this property, but man did we all benefit. What a spectacular tract of land!

We were blessed with 5 sections, plus a 6 th section as a A/B split. This was a real deal ECEA PA Enduro consisting of 4-6-mile sections of flowing, rocky and technical single track with constant elevation changes, some rock gardens, and a lot of brown forest dirt. There was a LOT of fresh cut trail. So How many of us got our handle bars wedged in between the giant boulders? I did! All of the sections were awesome, but man did section 3 stick out for me. Section 3 took us back to the parking area for lunch via 5 miles of single track mixed in with a Hare Scramble course that weaved up and down the ridge- what a wild ride! Pure Adrenaline
