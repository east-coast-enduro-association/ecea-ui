Triumph has been added as a contingency sponsor to both the Enduro AND Harescramble series! They are offering generous payouts to riders in any class. 

You can view the [HS payouts here](https://www.triumphracingcontingency.com/events/serie/67fe02d32333714f6f00925f) and [Enduro payouts here](https://www.triumphracingcontingency.com/events/serie/67fe02d32333714f6f009260).

Personally I look forward to seeing those new bikes on the start line. Look up your local Triumph dealer and come on out!
