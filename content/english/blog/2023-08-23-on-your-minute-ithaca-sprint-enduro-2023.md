Well I’m two days late on this race recap- because I spent the last two days cleaning the mud and grass off my bike. Wow what a race!

Ithaca Enduro Riders put on one Hell of an event this past Sunday despite some bad weather late in the week. On Friday before the race, the course was pummeled by over two inches of rain. The ground conditions of this course after two inches of rain would be best described as a combination of Vaseline and WD40 mixed with 2-3-foot long clumps of wet weeds. This concoction of materials loaded up on exhaust headers, calipers, rotors, wheels and chains like pre-historic cement.

Luckily for everyone the sun came out on Saturday and dried things up just enough that the puddles had bottoms by Sunday’s race. The course consisted of three sections with a predetermined number of tests based on class. Section A was the shortest the most technical, with some quick steep uphills that were rutted up and slippery as snot. We also got a quick run up a creek bed and a little grass track thrown in for good measure.
Section B was roots, fun and long uphill runs, lots of elevation changes, roots, mud and then some more mud and roots. Section C was the fastest with some great single and double track flow and some speedy grass track sections tossed in with a short creek run to the finish line. 

This was a Super fun and challenging course and not for the faint of heart. After the race the parking area was filled with smiling, exhausted riders who looked like they and their bikes were just pulled out of the bottom of a swamp.
