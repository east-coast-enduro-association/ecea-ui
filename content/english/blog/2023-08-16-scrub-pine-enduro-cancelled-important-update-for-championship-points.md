Unfortunately, Scrub Pine Enduro is cancelled due to understaffing at the Brendan T. Byrne Forest. 

With the cancellations of Scrub Pine Enduro, StumpJumper Enduro, and Moonshine Enduro, our 2023 ECEA Championship Enduro Series is now at 12 events. This makes SPER's Michaux Enduro the final enduro of the 2023 season.

Championship points for the enduro series classes will now be based off of the individual’s best NINE (9) enduro results of the season. Individuals will NOW need to complete a minimum of FIVE (5) events to be eligible for a year-end award. Club members must work their event to qualify for class points.

*Specialty Classes (*Masters, Golden Masters, Legends, and Women’s class competitors are NOW required to finish four (4) or compete in FIVE (5) enduros to be eligible for end-of-year awards.

Championship points for the enduro series OVERALL will still be based on all events ridden of the season.

OCCR, MCI, VFTR, and RORR members have been assigned to work another enduro event by the ECEA Referee. If you are a member of one of those clubs and you are running for points, you are STRONGLY encouraged to reach out to your club president for your work assignment.
