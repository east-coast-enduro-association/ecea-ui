It is with great disappointment that Delaware Valley Trail Riders is cancelling Dirty Santa Toy Run in 2025. 

The club has put in hundreds of man hours in the past 2 months in an effort to host the event at its new venue but unfortunately mother nature is not on our side. The roads are covered in a sheet of ice and it is not safe to drive in to the event or ride from the parking area to the trail system. 

This is the first time in the events history that the club has had to cancel. Big thanks to the volunteers who scrambled to make this event happen despite the 20 degree temperatures and frozen soil.
