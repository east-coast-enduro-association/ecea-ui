A message from PBER and SJER.

Unfortunately we are forced to cancel Sahara sands for this year. We are unable to secure a new date with the landowner due to hunting season. Thank you all for understanding and see you next year.

If you planned on attending please considering still donating to the local fire department as they depend on this fundraiser to make it through the rest of the year. We would greatly appreciate any contribution made to them. Thank you!

From the ECEA HSC: This puts us at 8 events so there will be zero drops this season.
