There's a mountain. There are rocks on it. Sometimes it's foggy, sometimes it's not. Point your dirtbike at it and open the throttle already.

**Note on split course:**

The classes riding the split course (the final section) are as follows: 

AA (all motor sizes/ages)

A-200 (98cc -200cc)

A-250 (201cc -250cc)

A-Open (251cc & up)

A-Veteran (Age 30 & up)

A-Senior 40+ (Age 40 & up)

A-Senior 45+ (Age 45 & up)

A-Senior 50+ (Age 50 & up)

The confirmation sheet is correct. The route sheet incorrectly states that A50+ skips the final section when in fact they should ride it. There will be ample signage on the trail indicating the split.
