## This event has reached their rider limit and registration has closed

Don't miss the annual and highly regarded ECEA Enduro opener, Greenbrier Enduro! Bring your sand tires but watch out for those roots! I hope it snows again.

The Registration team STRONGLY ENCOURAGES all riders to check-in on Saturday, especially if you need a new or replacement transponder tag.

Hours are posted on your entry (4p-6pm) SATURDAY. Check-in may remain open later. SUNDAY check-in opens at 6am and will close at 9am. If you are on a later row, you must be registered before 9am. The scoring team needs time to upload all information for scoring purposes.

The confirmation sheet and route sheet can be found on this page in the "Event Details" section.

The property owners will once again provide meals for purchase. Meals will be available Saturday afternoon and all-day Sunday. Please come hungry and support our generous landowners. Trash is your responsibility. If you bring it, please take it with you.

Most importantly, we thank you for your love of enduros and your support to keep this sport alive and kicking. We have put a lot of work to make this event awesome for everyone.
