A New Jersey staple in the enduro community. How many years has this event been hosted? Somebody should update the page with that info... 

If you feel that you are just trying to get your feet wet in enduro, this is a beginner friendly event. If you're a pro, don't let that comment mislead you. CDR will be playing timekeeping games with your head and keep you wondering when it's time to push or when to hold back!
