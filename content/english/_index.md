  description: The ECEA is the largest promoter of off-road motorcycling in the United States in terms of membership,
    participants, and number of events. We offer something for all abilities and ages; from non-competitive trail

    name the terrain or conditions and without a doubt, there will be a motorcycle fit for the task and a rider ready
    for the challenge. The East Coast Enduro Association (ECEA) offers something great for everyone from four years
    old to eighty years young!
