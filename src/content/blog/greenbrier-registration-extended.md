## Attention ECEA Enduro riders competing for points: 

This is your final opporunity to register for [TCSMC Greenbrier Enduro](/events/enduro/23-en-tcsmc). Registration will be opening on Wednesday, March 1st at 7pm EST.

Due to some technical issues on Friday night when registration first opened, we are giving our competing riders a second change to register for the event. **There are limited spots available.** We hope this alleviates any issues you previously encountered and remember to get your thumbs on that registration link promptly at 7pm.

As a reminder, to register for an enduro, go to the Schedule and navigate to the [TCSMC Greenbrier Enduro](/events/enduro/23-en-tcsmc). There you will see all relevant information including a link to pre-enter. Alternately, you can visit the moto-tally link directly here https://www.moto-tally.com/ECEA/Enduro/PreEntry.aspx
