# Welcome to the New ECEA Website

We're excited to announce the launch of the completely redesigned East Coast Enduro Association website. Whether you're a seasoned competitor or just discovering the world of off-road racing, this new site is designed to be your central hub for everything ECEA.

## What's New

### Comprehensive Event Calendar

Find every race on our redesigned **Events** page. Browse events by year, filter by event type (Enduro, Hare Scramble, or FastKIDZ), and get all the details you need in one place:

- Event dates and locations
- Hosting club information
- Registration links
- Event flyers and course information
- Direct links to results after the race

You can even **export events to your calendar** - add individual races or the entire season to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or any calendar app that supports ICS files.

### Results at Your Fingertips

The **Results** section connects you directly to official race results through our partnership with Moto-Tally. Check:

- Start grids before the race
- Live and final results
- Championship standings throughout the season
- Enduro Team Competition standings
- Historical results from previous years

Race photos are also linked through our Facebook community pages, so you can relive the action from each event.

### Get Started Guide

New to ECEA? The **Get Started** section walks you through everything you need to know:

- Understanding our racing series (Enduro, Hare Scramble, FastKIDZ, and Dual Sport)
- How to register for your first event
- Where to get your race number

- What to expect at your first race

This is the perfect starting point for anyone curious about off-road motorcycle racing on the East Coast.

### Club Directory

ECEA is powered by 19 member clubs stretching from New York to Virginia. The **Clubs** page features:

- Complete profiles for each club
