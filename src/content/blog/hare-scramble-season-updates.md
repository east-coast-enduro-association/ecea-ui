**This weeks Hare Scramble at Sahara Sands is Postponed.**\
The official fire warning in that area is extreme and dust will be a concern with safety. \
\
**A reschedule date is being considered and will be announced asap.**\
If this Event at Sahara becomes canceled, the season will have ended at the Fall Brawl.\
In that case, with 8 events for the series, ALL races count and NO thow aways per rules.
