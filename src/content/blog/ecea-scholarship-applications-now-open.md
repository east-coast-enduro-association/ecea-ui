##### Application Period Opens for East Coast Enduro Association Scholarships

Hainesport, NJ, June 4, 2023: The East Coast Enduro Association (ECEA) invites applications for its annual scholarships – the Mike Little Memorial and the Skip Stoner Memorial each worth $500. The East Coast Enduro Association (ECEA) has two scholarship programs in place – the ‘Mike Little Memorial Scholarship’ and the ‘Skip Stoner Memorial Scholarship’. Each have been set up to recognize ECEA riders both academically and technically with their commitment to the ECEA’s amateur sport of off- road riding in the memories of long-time devoted ECEA members, Mike Little and Skip Stoner.
