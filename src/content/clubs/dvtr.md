## About Our Club

Trail riding is where it all started, and for most, it’s the sole reason for riding motorcycles. Some of us prefer to ride gravel roads though the majestic forests of the NorthEast, while others enjoy pushing their bodies and their machines to the limit in some of the gnarliest terrain found. One thing we have in common is that feeling at the end of the ride when we sit around and harass each other about random things.

​Del Val Trail Riders was founded on the belief that there is power in numbers. Our goal is to build our membership numbers and use that leverage for the good of the sport. We strive to improve the riding community by building rapport with landowners, public officials and the general public through our combined efforts. This means that as a member of DVTR, we ask that you volunteer in a few events a year; which could be helping out with a race, a trail clean-up or maybe a roadside clean-up. We always welcome suggestions on how we can get more involved in our communities.

Each December we have our Toys-For-Tots Dirty Santa Toy Run, which is the single-most important event you can participate in each year. For this event, it’s all hands on deck so that we can continue to make the massive donations to Toys-For-Tots that we have in past years.
