## About Our Club

In January 1963 four dirt riders had a meeting at Jack Wright’s house in Runnemede, New Jersey, to discuss forming a AMA-sanctioned riding club just for enduro riders that would promote off road riding through competition.Bill Schemel suggested “South Jersey Enduro Riders” and the name stuck. Officers were elected: Jack Wright, President; Bill Schemel,
Secretary; Woody Molineaux, Treasurer; and, Bill Bandenstein, Referee. The first order of business was to request an AMA Charter, which Bill Schemel paid for out of his own pocket. (He also paid for the second year as well.)
Membership cards were printed, and new members were recruited from local enduros. “No dues, no meetings, join SJER so you can ride as a club team” was the motto. New members were signed up on the hood of Bill Schemel’s truck.
Woody came up with the idea of handing out vests with “candystripes” on them. Six vests were made up with the red and white vertical stripes, which were collected at the end of the run. Eventually members started buying their own, and a tradition was started.

Ben Trimble was soon elected president. The membership grew. Meetings were at first held at the Cliff Ferris Cycle Shop in Mt. Holly. They would move around over the years – the Mt. Holly Diner, Cramer’s Cycle Shop (Vincentown), Villa D Tavern (Tabernacle) and the Country Tavern (Indian Mills) to name a few.

1966 was a big year for SJER. Bill Schemel headed the ByLaws Committee, and a charter was drawn up. The club was incorporated by the State of New Jersey that year. Clarence Hyde took care of the incorporation for free. Woody Molineaux founded the first promoted event and named it the “Curly Fern Enduro”. Sam Shontz created the club logo.

The enduro gained popularity and in 1969 South Jersey Enduro Riders held their first national event. Neil Forsyth was Trail Boss and the enduro started at the Whitings Fire House. All the trail was new. Neil cut trail, built bridges, and stopped counting the hours he worked when he got to 2000. The club came together to make it all happen.
The Curly Fern Enduro started at many locations over the years: Pic-A-Lilly in Atsion, C&D Diner in Medford, and the Chatsworth Fire Company in Chatsworth in addition to the Whitings Fire House.

SJER would host National Championships in 1974,1975, and 1979. In 1981 Ocean County Competition Riders (OCCR) and SJER joined forces to promote the Forked River Mountain National Enduro.
The National Championships were long events, usually 100 miles or more. It was a huge undertaking. Overall the club has maintained hundreds if not thousands of miles of trail in New Jersey over the last 47 years.

The ECEA held ISDE qualifiers in 1975, and 1977 at Coyle Field on Rt. 72. SJER riders took part in these international events.
Today, large portions of the forest we once rode are off limits due to state mandates and changes in policy. Our event is now held primarily in Wharton State Forest and starts at the Indian Mills Gun Club in Shamong. SJER has held an enduro every year for the past 44 years and hopes to continue the tradition.

Our meetings are now held on the first Tuesday of each month at the Pic-A-Lilly Inn on Rt. 206 in Shamong, NJ. Come join us – our meetings start around 7:30 pm.
