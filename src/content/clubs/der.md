## About Our Club

Joining our club is simple. Just show up at a meeting and ask for an application. You will be asked to pay the lifetime dues fee of $2 (that’s right, two dollars) and have your picture taken. After filling out the application, you will be a candidate for membership for approximately one year before you will be eligible for full membership. Membership is not automatic, you must be voted in. Candidates may participate in all club activities, they just cannot vote.

Candidates are reviewed periodically throughout the year. Mainly we are looking for your interest level through racing, attending meetings, and helping with the events. RACING IS NOT REQUIRED, but helping with events is.

The first Tuesday of each month is a business meeting starting at 8:30 PM. All other Tuesdays are unofficial meeting nights starting around 8:30 PM or thereabouts. At the meetings we talk about upcoming races, hash over last week’s race, or just talk motorcycles in general. Meetings are very informal and visitors are welcome. Just come by any Tuesday night!
