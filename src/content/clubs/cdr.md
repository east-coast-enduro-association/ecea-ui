## About Our Club

Competition Dirt Riders (CDR) is a group of off-road motorcycle enthusiasts. We are an AMA chartered club, ECEA sanctioned and sponsor 2 points paying events and 1 fun event each year - the Beehive Enduro, Ormond Farms Hare Scramble and Ormond farms fun ride weekend. We have club members that compete in the Enduro and Hare Scramble series as well as members who participate in non-competitive trail riding. 

As an active member you are also able to attend our annual summer barbecue and our annual New Years Ride. We are also active in helping Fish & Game with their annual trash pick-up and tree planting.

Motorcycle racing is not a requirement to be a member of CDR. CDR is interested in people who are 18 years of age or older and are willing to be involved in Club activities and are willing to help put on our events.

Our meetings are currently held at the American Legion on Buck Street in Millville on the last Wednesday of the month 7pm.
