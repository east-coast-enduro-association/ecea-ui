## About Our Club

Established in 1972, the home of the Shotgun Enduro and National Hare Scrambles in the 70’s and 80’s.Our Membership is comprised of a variety of folks, racers, riders, enthusiasts, young and old.

HMDR promotes our annual Shotgun Hare Scramble in CataWissa, PA and our ShotGun Enduro in Delano, PA.
We have experimented with Sprint enduros and hope to continue in the near future.

HMDR also has many club rides coupled with trail work and even a road clean up on Lofty road.
