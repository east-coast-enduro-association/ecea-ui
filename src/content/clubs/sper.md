## About Our Club

Home of the Michaux Enduro and the Oxbo Hare Scrambles. We are your local East Coast Enduro Association affiliated off-road motorcycle club. Come on out to one of our events to twist a grip or stop by a monthly meeting.
Our meetings are held monthly on the second Wednesday of the month at 7:30 PM at VFW Post #7415,
107-109 3rd St, New Cumberland.
