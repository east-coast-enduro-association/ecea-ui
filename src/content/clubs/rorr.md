## About Our Club

Reading Off Road Riders club members strive to bring you the best in off-road competition from the course layout to professionally run events. Memberships are open to new members if you’re thinking about joining our club. We have monthly meetings at the Blue Marsh Italian Restaurant, on the second Wednesday at 7PM. You must attend the meetings to be voted into RORR.

We operate several events yearly. Enduro, Hare Scramble, Hard Enduro, and a Dual Sport. Our membership has grown steadily over the past few years and our success is because of volunteers like yourselves. Our pride has shown itself to our participants. Our courses may not be the easiest to traverse, which makes our jobs even harder. The hard work from our members is justly rewarded by not only putting on a quality professional event, but by clubs social events held at various times throughout the year. We meet often to just ride, we help our land-owners and boroughs by doing cleanup duties, and have 2 annual RORR parties. So come out a join the club and have some fun!
