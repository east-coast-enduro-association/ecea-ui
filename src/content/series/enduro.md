## What is an Enduro?

An enduro is a time-keeping format of off-road motorcycle racing where riders follow a marked course and attempt to maintain a set pace through timed sections. Unlike a hare scramble where the first rider across the finish line wins, enduros test your ability to ride consistently at a predetermined speed.

## How It Works

- **Key Time**: Each rider is assigned a "key time" - their official start time
- **Checkpoints**: The course has multiple checkpoints where your time is recorded
- **Scoring**: Points are deducted for arriving early or late at checkpoints
- **Winner**: The rider with the fewest penalty points wins their class

## What You Need

- An off-road motorcycle in good working condition
- [AMA membership](https://www.americanmotorcyclist.com/membership/)
