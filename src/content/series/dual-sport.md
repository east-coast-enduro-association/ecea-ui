## What is a Dual Sport?

A dual sport ride is an adventure event that combines paved roads with off-road trails. Using street-legal motorcycles, riders explore scenic routes through forests, mountains, and countryside. It's not a race—it's about the journey and the experience.

## How It Works

- **Route Sheet**: Riders follow a detailed route sheet with turn-by-turn directions
- **Mixed Terrain**: Routes include paved roads, gravel roads, and off-road trails
- **Self-Paced**: Ride at your own pace; it's not a competition
- **Checkpoints**: Some rides have checkpoints for rest stops and camaraderie

## What You Need

- **Street-Legal Motorcycle**: Must be registered and insured for road use
- Valid motorcycle license
- [AMA membership](https://www.americanmotorcyclist.com/membership/)
- ECEA membership (registration varies by hosting club - check individual event pages)
- Full tank of gas (routes can be remote)
