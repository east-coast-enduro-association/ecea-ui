## What is a Hare Scramble?

A hare scramble is a mass-start off-road motorcycle race where all riders in a class line up and start together. The first rider to complete the required laps wins. It's exciting, competitive, and tests both speed and endurance.

## How It Works

- **Mass Start**: Riders line up in rows and start when the flag drops
- **Marked Course**: Follow the marked trail through woods, fields, and technical sections
- **Laps**: Complete the required number of laps (typically 2-3 hours of racing)
- **Winner**: First rider across the finish line wins their class

## Race Format

- Races are typically 2-3 hours long
- Course lengths vary from 5-12 miles per lap
- Terrain includes single track, fire roads, and open fields
- Pit areas allow for refueling and quick repairs

## What You Need

- An off-road motorcycle (2-stroke or 4-stroke)
- [AMA membership](https://www.americanmotorcyclist.com/membership/)
- [ECEA Hare Scramble membership](https://www.moto-tally.com/ECEA/ECEA/SeriesRegistration.aspx) or day pass (available at registration)
- Full safety gear (helmet, boots, chest protector, gloves, goggles)
- Gas can for refueling (for longer races)

## Classes

Classes are divided by skill level (A, B, C) and age groups. There are also displacement-based classes and specialty classes like Women's and Senior.
