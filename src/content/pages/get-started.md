  The ECEA is the most diverse off-road association around with something for everyone—families, youth riders, racers, and enthusiasts alike. As an AMA-chartered organization since 1971, we've been bringing riders together for over 50 years.

  Racing is just part of what we do. Many of our members volunteer, spectate, and enjoy the lifelong friendships formed at our events. Whether you want to compete for championships or just enjoy a weekend ride with family, there's a place for you here.
