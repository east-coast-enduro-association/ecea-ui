SJER is bringing enduro to our rising enduro riders! The club puts together a great, singletrack trail for the kids to race sprint enduro style. One rider out every 30 seconds and your finish is based on your total time through the trail. Depending on the riders classification, they will do anywhere from 2 to 6 laps.

Bring a bbq or a picnic, set up next to the trail, and you'll see your rider come through several times!
