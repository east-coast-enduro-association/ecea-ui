This year as a co-sanction with the American National Enduro Championship - sign up on live laps, not moto-tally.

Watch out for the weather here or you might be wishing you brought a rain coat and some taller knobs. Smooth, fast trail with decent elevation change. Minimal rocks but plenty of roots!
