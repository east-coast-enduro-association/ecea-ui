When you think Pennsylvania, do you think rocks? Throw that characterization out of your mind and think "if my front wheel comes out of this rut, the bike is going to slide down the whole damn mountain". It's fun, you should go.

**A message from the club:**

Thank you for entering the 2024 Three Springs Enduro!



Below is some information you will find helpful in making your time in Three Springs more enjoyable.



The Community Pool is open and free for you to use Saturday and Sunday.



The Friends of The Three Springs Community Pool will again have an EZ up at Gas available with drinks and snacks for everyone. They really appreciate the support they receive from the riders and the Club and want show it.



The Fire Company is having a spaghetti dinner Saturday evening starting at 7 pm.



The Landowners at the Club House section will again have drinks available.  Make sure you thank the ladies.  All of our sections are on private property. Without the support of our landowners there would be no event.
